## 💻 Code Example
Here’s a simple example of fetching repositories using the GitHub API in Python:

```python
import requests

def fetch_repositories(topic):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q={topic}"
    headers = {"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()["items"]
    else:
        return []

# Example usage
topic = "machine learning"
repos = fetch_repositories(topic)
for repo in repos[:5]:
    print(f"{repo['name']} - {repo['html_url']}")
```

This function fetches repositories based on a topic and prints the top results. More advanced functionality will be integrated into the AI-powered navigator!
